### Group name: Assignment 3 Groups 92

## Overview

This project implements a **multi-threaded merge sort** using the **pthread** library in C.  
It explores how concurrency improves performance by sorting subarrays in parallel up to a user-defined thread depth (`cutoff`).  
The assignment demonstrates **inter-thread synchronization**, **recursion**, and **shared memory coordination**.

## Building the project

### ðŸ§© Compile

```bash
make
```

This generates the executable: **test-mergesort**

### Clean

```bash
make clean
```

### Environment

- macOS
- GCC

## Features and usage

### Run Command

```bash
./test-mergesort <array_size> <cutoff_level> <random_seed>
```

### Example

```bash
./test-mergesort 100000 3 42
```

## Testing

- Basic Execution Test : Serial execution (cutoff=0) with 100 random elements
- Parallel Execution Test: Parallel sorting (cutoff=2) with 1000 elements
- Medium Input Test: Parallel sorting (cutoff=3) with 10,000 elements

## Reflection and Self Assessment

At first, we had a problem where the main thread finished too early because pthread_exit() was called in the wrong place.
As a result, the program ended before it could print the final sorting result on Gradescope.
We fixed this by making only non-root threads call pthread_exit(NULL), while the main thread simply returned normally.

We also learned that recursive parallel sorting needs careful management of the argument structures â€” each thread must have its own data to avoid conflicts or memory leaks.
After testing different configurations, we realized that efficient multithreading depends on finding the right balance between the number of threads and the amount of work each thread handles.

This project helped us better understand thread synchronization, performance optimization, and concurrency at the system level.
